### Themes
Select a theme - notice you can enable preview and see the theme in a realtime preview.
When clicking this tab for the first time you will need to confirm that it's okay to download the different themes from the remote themes site (https://lazemss.github.io/OctoPrint-UICustomizerThemes/) this is done in so we can update themes without updating the plugin.

### Layout
![](extras/s2.png)<br/><br/>
The layout of the screen can be made into 1,2 or 3 columns and the size of the columns can be adjusted. The total width of the columns added together must not be greater than 12. Each column can contain zero or more widgets, widgets are the diffent "containers" for all the user interface, ie. the webcam, files etc.
If you want a two or one column layout then just drag the "widgets" all the widgets into the left hand side columns.
Each widget can be moved by draging. The widgets can also be hidden by clicking the eye on the right hand side of the widget.
Notice there is 3 extras widgets included with UI Customizer:
- Webcam widget which allows you to have a webcam outside the main Control tab
- Gcode widget which allows you to have a gcode viewer outside the main Gcode viewer tab
- Temperature widget which allows you to have the temperature outside the main Temperature tab

### Main tabs
![](extras/s3.png)<br/><br/>
The main/center tabs can be changed using this settings panel.
* The up and down arrow is used to change the order of the tabs
* The first field is for entering a custom name for the tab, if left blank it will use default.
* The "eye" icon can show or hide the entire tab and its content - click to toggle show/hide.
* The next icon is used to the change the icon and color of icon, shown in the tab. If no icon is selected then a blue magnifying glass is shown. Click the icon to get a dialog up for searching icons and picking a color. Enter a searchword and the icon you want and color using the "eye-dropper". Click the trashcan icon if you dont want to select an icon.
* The last dropdown is to change what is shown on the tab: Icon + Text (Icon on the left - text on the right), Text + Icon, Icon only, Text only - notice its not possible to make "empty" tabs ie. selecting "Icon only" and then no icon is selected

Icon size allows you to pick the size of the icons on the tab icons.


### Top icons
![](extras/s4.png)<br/><br/>
This allows you to change the look & feel of the top icons in top menu/navbar
* Compact ["Navbar temperature plugin"](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/navbartemp/) - will add icons and shrink the temperature display on this awesome plugin
